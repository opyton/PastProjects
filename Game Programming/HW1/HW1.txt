2a) What made minecraft a success? 
	I believe that came down to how open it felt. The fact that you could make the game to be anything you wanted it to be attracted many people, I think. 
(2 b) What part of the documentary had the most impact on you?
	When Notch talked about how he never really felt like he had "made it". It struck me that as a developer you just do your job like anyone else and if something comes up, it cane be incredible, but you don't have to strive to reach a certain goal. Instead it is good to do what you enjoy and take successes and failures as they come.
(2 c) What is critique of the game itself (the good, and the bad)? 
	A good critique that revolutionized the gaming industry was the idea behind deploying Minecraft in "beta". I think as it was a success, this was viewed as a good idea, but if it had failed, this ideology might have been used as a reason for doing so.
